# Lung-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML
A lung disease prediction project uses AI to analyze chest X-ray images and detect lung problems like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or cancer early. It applies deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), trained on thousands of medical images to spot disease patterns that doctors might miss.
